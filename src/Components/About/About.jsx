            We stablished this business 2 years ago , First it came in our mind while the
            pandemic ( corrona virus ) started the first product was a manly
            scarf , i could not stop using my talent in crochet i could not get
            enough ... So my friends said why dont you start your own business?
            <br /><br /> And the begining was at July 2020 People started to admire my
            work and Began to make order And that was the only thing that get me
            out from Depression , For me doing crochet isn't just a job , its a
            life , I creat each items with love so that where the group name
            came from ,
            <br /><br />
            Thanks for all people supporting my business you are not just
            supporting business you are supporting my <strong>LIFE DREAM</strong>
